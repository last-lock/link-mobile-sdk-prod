"""Reference backend for Aliro BLE credential exchange with Link Mobile SDK.

The lock is the *reader*, the phone is the *user device*, and this server is the
*Credential Issuer*. An Access Document (AD) is an issuer-signed statement that
binds a phone credential's public key to a validity interval and access data.
It is not an unlock command or the credential's private key. The phone stores
the AD and presents it to the lock during a BLE unlock. See the Aliro 1.0
specification, sections 7 and 8.4, for the document and presentation formats:
https://csa-iot.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/26-42802-001_Aliro_1.0_specification.pdf

This example has three separate operations:

1. ``POST /v1/configure`` prepares a provisioned lock to recognize this issuer.
   After the lock reports its reader public key to Link, the server signs a
   reader certificate and asks Link to deliver the reader-group identifier,
   certificate, issuer public key, and accepted access element identifier to
   the lock. A successful response means delivery was queued, not completed.
2. ``POST /v1/issue-unlock-pass`` signs an AD for a public key created by the
   mobile SDK. The phone keeps the matching private key. The response includes
   the AD and reader-group trust material: the lock uses the former to check
   the phone, and the SDK uses the latter to authenticate the lock.
3. ``POST /v1/install-mode`` asks Link to enter or exit install mode. Link
   builds the signed install payload and pushes it on the plane stream. If a
   firmware image is pending, an enter request includes that DFU. A successful
   response means the command was queued. The phone delivers it and waits
   until the lock advertises the new mode.

The AD does not name a device ID. Every lock configured to accept this issuer
key and access element may accept the same pass. This sample does not
authenticate HTTP callers or implement per-user/per-lock authorization.

The server persists two private signing keys and its reader-group identifier.
Do not delete TOKEN_UNLOCK_DATA_DIR after configuring locks: they will not
trust newly issued passes from a replacement issuer key.

The only Link dependency is the generated public ``proto/org.proto`` Python
client in this directory's ``gen/`` folder. Set ``ORG_NAME`` to the hosted
Link organization slug; the server connects to that org over TLS on port 443.
Set ``LINK_GRPC_ADDR`` to dial another address, such as a local org at
``localhost:3001``, and ``LINK_GRPC_SECURE=false`` for a plaintext connection.

Note: Example code only — not for production use. This code demonstrates SDK integration and is 
provided “as is,” without warranties or guarantees of security, correctness, or support. It omits 
production safeguards and has not been validated for use in a production access-control system. 
You are responsible for implementing and independently validating authentication, authorization, 
key management, and other security controls before deploying any system based on this example.
